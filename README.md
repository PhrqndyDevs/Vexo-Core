👋 About Me
Hey! I'm Phrqndy, the head developer of PhrqndyDevStudio, where we craft innovative and engaging Private Minecraft Plugins for the PocketMine community. My current focus is on creating Bedwars and SkyWars experiences with dynamic, seasonal themes, blending creativity with smooth functionality. 🛠️✨

I enjoy turning ideas into code and learning new technologies to improve gameplay and user experience. Whether it’s designing features, creating custom UIs, or optimizing game mechanics, I’m all about delivering something fun and unique!

When I’m not coding, you can find me exploring new game mods, staying up-to-date with the latest trends in game development, or diving into my next creative project. 🎮💡

Let's build something awesome together! 👾


This Is The Main Core For Vexo, It Is Open Source, Meaning You Can Add More Features, Improve It, And More!
